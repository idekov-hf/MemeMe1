# MemeMe1

iOS app that was created for Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree Program.
Create custom memes by selecting an image from your photo library or by using your camera and adding text to the top and bottom of the image. After your meme is complete, share it with your friends by tapping on the top left navigation bar button to bring up sharing options.
